## Opening Framing (5 min)

Why are we learning MongoDB and Mongoose?

>CRUD is something that is necessary in most every application out there. We have to create, read, update, and delete information all the time.

When would we use MongoDB (non-relational) versus PostgreSQL (relational)?

>HINT theres not always a right answer!

## Mongoose (5 min)

>"Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote Mongoose."

## http://mongoosejs.com

Mongoose is an ORM, that allows us to encapsulate and model our data in our applications. It gives us access to additional helpers, functions, and queries to simply and easily preform CRUD actions.

Review example on [mongoosejs.com](http://mongoosejs.com)

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

var Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

var kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildjian' });
kitty.save(function (err) {
  if (err) // ...
  console.log('meow');
});
```
<!-- AM: How exactly are you going to review the above example in-class? Might be useful to include the main takeaways here as notes in this section of the lesson plan, if there are any. -->

## You-Do - Step 1: Initial Set Up for Reminders (5 min)

We will be creating a 2 model Todo App using Mongo/Mongoose. Authors have many Reminders.

1. Fork and Clone this Repo:[https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo]
<!-- AM: Link formatting is a lil' funky here. -->

2. Make sure to checkout locally to `mongoose` branch: `$ git checkout mongoose`

[Starter Code](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/tree/mongoose)

[Solution Code](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/tree/mongoose-solution)

## Mongoose Installation and Connection Set Up (5 min)

```bash
$ npm install mongoose --save
```

The first thing we need to do is require mongoose in our project and open a connection to the test database on our locally

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');
```
```js

var db = mongoose.connection;

// will console.log an error if db cannot connect to MongoDB
db.on('error', function(err){
  console.log(err);
});
// will console.log "database has been connected" if successfully connects
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log("database has been connected!");

  // INSERT CODE HERE!

});
```

Now let's run our `db/schema.js` file:

```bash
$ node db/schema.js
```

## You-Do - Step 2: Install Mongoose and Connection (5 min)

Follow Instructions for `Step 2` on the `readme.md`
<!-- AM: We are currently in "Step 2". I think you mean the previous section. -->

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/blob/267a908faaae06ab4c35da6d671a867cf1bc6426/db/schema.js)

## Mongoose Schema & Models (10 min)

**What is a Mongoose Schema?**

* Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema!

* Schemas are used to define attributes and structure for our documents

* Each Schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection

Mongoose Schema Example:

```js

// instantiate a name space for our Schema constructor defined by mongoose.
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
})

```
**What are Mongoose Models?**

* Mongoose Models will represent documents in our database. They are essentially constructors, which will allow us to preform CRUD actions with our MongoDB Database.

* Models are defined by passing a Schema instance to mongoose.model.

```js
var StudentModel = mongoose.model("Student", StudentSchema)
```
>The .model() function makes a copy of schema. Make sure that you've added everything you want to schema before calling .model()!

>The first argument is the singular name of the collection your model is for. Mongoose automatically looks for the plural version of your model name.

>The model `Student` is for the `students` collection in the database.

## Embedded Documents VS Multiple Collections (10 min)

Now, Let's add another model to our `db/schema.js`.

We will be adding a schema now for `Project`, since I want to create an application that tracks Students and Projects.

Similar to how you might think of a one to many relationship in a relational database, A Student will have many Projects. We will be accomplishing this relationship through `embedded` or `sub` documents.

How can we describe this relationship in Mongoose?

### Embedded Documents

[Embedded Documents](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/embedded-documents.html)

What are Embedded Documents?

>Docs with schemas of their own which are elements of a parents document array,  contain all the same features as normal documents.

>The only difference is that embedded documents are not saved individually, they are saved whenever their top-level parent document is saved.

```js
var ProjectSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  unit: String
})


var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  projects: [ProjectSchema]
})

```
>The projects key of your ProjectSchema documents will then be an instance of DocumentArray. This is a special subclassed Array that can deal with casting, and has special methods to work with embedded documents.

<!-- AM: Some terms here whose definitions aren't immediately apparent: "casting", "subclassed" -->

(+) Advantages:
* Embedded Documents are easy and fast

(-) Disadvantages:
* Overhead and Scalability. Can't exceed 16MD per document

### Multiple Collections/Population

[Population](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)

Similar to how we added a foreign key in PostgreSQL, we can add references to documents in other collections by storing an array of `ObjectIds` referencing document ids from another Model

```js
var ProjectSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  unit: String,
  students: [{type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: "Student"}]
});

var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  projects: [ {type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: "Project"} ]
});

```
<!-- AM: Might be helpful to explicitly define the arguments that go into `students` and `projects` in this examples (e.g., "What exactly is ref: 'Project'?")-->

(+) Advantages:
* Separate Collections offer greater flexibility with querying
* Separate Collections might be a better decision for scaling- A document, including all its embedded documents and arrays, cannot exceed 16MB

(-) Disadvantages:
* Requires more work, need to find both documents that have the relationship(two separate queries)

### When should I use one over the other?

* Separate Collections are preferable if you need to select individual documents, need additional control over queries, or have large documents.

* Smaller or fewer documents would be a better fit for embedded documents


We will be using `embedded` or sub documents today in class!

## You-Do: Step 3: Set Up Schema and Models (10 min)

Follow Step 3 to step up your Reminder and Author Schemas and Models
<!-- AM: Same deal as "Step 2" - aren't we on "Step 3" now? -->

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/blob/cfee42d3cfd0bf5f2581cc61ba712eb8e1b7777f/db/schema.js)

## Create (10 min)
<!-- AM: What type of section is this (guessing "I Do")? -->

**Create Example:**

```js

var anna = new Student({name: "Anna", age: 30});

anna.save(function(err, person){
  if(err){
    console.log(err);
  }
  else{
    console.log(person);
  }
});

// OR

Student.create({ name: 'Anna', age: 30 }, function (err, person) {
  if (err){
    console.log(err);
  }
  else{
    console.log(person);
  }
});
```

**Embedded Documents Example: Add Project**

```js
var project1 = new ProjectModel({title: "memory game", unit: "JS"});

becky.projects.push(project1)
becky.save(function(err, student){
  if(err){
    console.log(err)
  }
  else{
    console.log(student + " was saved to our db!");
  }
});
```

## Seeds Data (10 min)

We need to make sure we can connect our `schema.js` file to our `seeds.js`.

In order to do that we need to add the following in our `db/schema.js`:

```js
module.exports ={
  StudentModel: StudentModel,
  ReminderModel: ReminderModel
};
```

And add the following in `db/seeds.js`:

```js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = require("../db/schema.js");

var StudentModel = Schema.StudentModel
var ProjectModel = Schema.ProjectModel
```

**Seeds Data:**

In `db/seeds.js`:

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = require("../db/schema.js");

var StudentModel = Schema.StudentModel
var ProjectModel = Schema.ProjectModel

StudentModel.remove({}, function(err){
  console.log(err)
});
ProjectModel.remove({}, function(err){
  console.log(err)
});

var becky = new StudentModel({name: "becky"})
var brandon = new StudentModel({name: "brandon"})
var tom = new StudentModel({name: "tom"})

var project1 = new ProjectModel({title: "project1!!", unit: "JS"})
var project2 = new ProjectModel({title: "project2!!", unit: "Rails"})
var project3 = new ProjectModel({title: "project3!!", unit: "Angular"})
var project4 = new ProjectModel({title: "project4!!", unit: "Express"})

var students = [becky, brandon, tom]
var projects = [project1, project2, project3, project4]

for(var i = 0; i < students.length; i++){
  students[i].projects.push(projects[i], projects[i+2])
  students[i].save(function(err){
    if (err){
      console.log(err)
    }else {
      console.log("author was saved");
    }
  })
};

```
**Now Let's Test it out in the Command Line!**

```bash
$ mongo
$ show dbs
$ use test
$ show collections
$ db.students.find()
```

### Callback Functions

With most Mongoose Queries, we will be using a callback function, which will be called with two arguments (err, results)

>With this callback function, the query will be executed immediately and the results are then passed into the callback

<!-- AM: Good time to reference JS async as a reason why we're using callbacks. -->

## Break (10 min)

## You-Do - Step 4: Adds Seeds Data and Create New Documents (15 min)

Add seeds data to create new documents in our reminders MongoDB database!

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/commit/9b5a93841df550516e04778066cb43bd790c11f8)


## Mongoose Queries (10 min)

Like Active Record, Mongoose provides us with a variety of helper methods that allow us to easily retrieve documents from our database.

**Example Mongoose Queries**

```js
// finds all documents of specified model type can also use to specify key value pair in query
Model.find({}, callback)

// finds model by id
Model.findById(someId, callback)

// finds model by match a key value
Model.findOne({someKey: someValue}, callback)

// removes document that match key value
Model.remove({someKey: someValue}, callback)
```

**Find All Example**

```bash
$ mkdir controllers
$ touch controllers/studentsController.js
```

```js
var studentsController = {
  index: function(){
    StudentModel.find({}, function(err, docs){
      console.log(docs);
    });
  }
};

studentController.index();
```
**Find One Example**

```js
var studentController = {
  index: function(){
    StudentModel.find({}, function(err, docs){
      console.log(docs);
    });
  },
  show: function(req){
    StudentModel.findOne({"name": req.name}, function(err, docs){
      console.log(docs);
    });
  }
};
studentController.show({name: "becky"});
```

## You-Do: Step 5: Read (Index and Show) (10 min)

Create methods for adding functionality to see all authors and find one author

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/commit/d51081c0bf995bbd7f47883467da1c06a03de058)

## Update (5 min)

```js
  update: function(req, update){
    StudentModel.findOneAndUpdate(req, update, {new: true}, function(err, docs){
      if(err){
        console.log(err)
      }
      else{
        console.log(docs);
      }
    });
  }
};

studentController.update({name: "becky"}, {name: "Sarah"});
```
<!-- AM: Just so we're not listing code snippets in this section, it might be useful to include some notes (e.g., method definitions). Not essential, but noticed there were a lot of code snippets stringed together without commentary. -->

## You-Do: Step-6: Update Documents (10 min)

Write an update method to edit an author in our database.

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/commit/d51081c0bf995bbd7f47883467da1c06a03de058)


## Delete (5 min)

```js
  destroy: function(req){
    StudentModel.findOneAndRemove(req, function(err, docs){
      if(err){
        console.log(err);
      }
      else{
        console.log(docs);
      }
    });
  }
};

authorsController.destroy({name: "bob"});
```

## Break (10 min)

## You-Do: Step-7: Delete Documents (10 min)

Write destroy methods to delete documents from our database

[See Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/reminders_mongo/blob/469d3c09059c60b7779a8c3a8c2fb12aefcc779a/controllers/authors.controller.js)

## You-Do: Bonus: Adding and Deleting Embedded Documents  10 min)

Work to Write Code to Add and Delete Reminders from an Author document

## Validations (10 min)

Mongoose contains built in validators and an option to create custom validators as well.

Validators are defined at the field level of a document and are executed when the document is being saved. If a validation error occurs, the save operation is aborted and the error is passed to the callback.

**Built in Validators:**

* `required`: used to validate the field existence in Mongoose, which is placed in your schema in the field you want to validate.

Example: Let's say you want to verify the existence of a username field before you save the user document.

```js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  username: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  }
});

```
>This will validate the existence of the username field when saving the document, thus preventing the saving of any document that doesn't contain that field.

* `match`: type based validator for strings, placed in your fields for you schemas

Continuing off the above example, to validate your email field, you would need to change your UserSchema as follows:

```js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    index: true,
    match: /.+\@.+\..+/
  }
});
```

>The usage of a match validator here will make sure the email field value matches the given regex expression, thus preventing the saving of any document where the e-mail doesn't conform to the right pattern.

* `enum`: helps to define a set of strings that are only available for that field value.

```js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    index: true,
    match: /.+\@.+\..+/
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['Admin', 'Owner', 'User']
  },

});
```
>By Adding in `enum`, we are adding a validation to ensure only these three possible strings are saved in the document.

**Custom Validations:**

We can also define our own validators by using the validate property.

This validate property value is typically an array consisting of a validation function and an error message.

For example, if we want to validate the length of your user's password. To do so, you would have to make these changes in your UserSchema:

```js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  password: {
    type: String,
    validate: [
      function(password) {
        return password.length >= 6;
      },
      'Password should be longer'
    ]
  },
});
```
>This custom validator will make sure your user's password is at least six characters long or it will prevent it from saving the document

* `.pre` validation: middleware that are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions.

By using `.pre`, these are executed before validations.


```js
Userschema.pre("save", function(next) {
    var self = this;

    UserModel.findOne({email : this.email}, 'email', function(err, results) {
        if(err) {
            next(err);
        } else if(results) {
            console.warn('results', results);
            self.invalidate("email", "email must be unique");
            next(new Error("email must be unique"));
        } else {
            next();
        }
    });
});

```
